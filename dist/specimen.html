delivering Cognos solutions for businesses in many industries, often pushing Cognos to its limits.</p><p>So why hire us?</p><p>A lot of Cognos experts out there are simply that. Experts at Cognos, and not much else.</p><p>We&apos;re good at Cognos, but not just because of our knowledge of Cognos. We&apos;re good at Cognos because we also know and understand the technologies that support and surround Cognos.</p><p>We know data warehouses. We know that some problems are best solved with raw SQL. We know root cause analysis. We know how to code. And we work smart.</p><p>Most importantly, we&apos;re more interested in helping you solve your problems than selling you software licenses. If there&apos;s a nail that the Cognos hammer can&apos;t hit, <a href="/knodeo">we probably have a different hammer in our toolbox </a>that can do the job.</p><p>Do you need a difference maker on your Cognos project? <a href="mailto:just@assignittous.com?Subject=Cognos Services Request">Contact us now.</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class="content odd"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2>Cognos not a fit for you?</h2><p>We can still help.</p><p>Don&apos;t get us wrong, software like Cognos have their place, but they&apos;re designed to be everything to everyone, and that can leave your business out in the cold.</p><p>We&apos;ve designed and built Knodeo, which is a simple but powerful data warehouse, reporting and analysis framework.</p><p>Our framework allows you to build only what you need, with no added fluff. It&apos;s also better than building from scratch, as our stack is built from proven, open source technologies.</p><p>And the best part of our solution, is that your software licenses have zero cost. Yes, you read that right. You only pay us for the services work to build what you need.</p><p>Knodeo is built for companies that need a powerful reporting solution but without the huge costs required to just get a foot in the door.</p><p>Sound interesting? <a href="/knodeo">Learn more about Knodeo.</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class="content even"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2>Struggling to rein in your projects?</h2><p>We&apos;ve got something for that too.</p><p>In our years of running projects, we were never able to find a project management tool that was well suited to the challenges of running a consulting firm.</p><p>Inevitably, the software out there would get some things right, and other things horribly wrong.</p><p>In the end, we took matters into our own hands and rolled our own solution, Assign It To Me.</p><p>Assign It To Me is a web-based, mobile friendly tool that helps consulting firms like ours run projects profitably and successfully.</p><p>We relied on our analytics background to develop a system that gives us a snapshot of the health of our projects.
